In this cloudformation stack deployment there are two steps to follow.

  1.Setup an AWS four(4) stage CI/CD pipeline with manual approval in each steps.
  2.Writing a template for an architecture using few AWS services.
  
First step we have to build a CI/CD pipeline using cloudformation template. For this I have used AWS services for all the steps during stack creation.
